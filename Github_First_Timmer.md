## Github First Timmer

First of all do not be scared or nervous. I was because all of my knowledge is from the textbook/lab that have been given to me from the Professor's. 

Setting up personal site for Github using https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

With the above link I had several questions because I made mistakes:

For instance I copied and pasted into the web browser and not into the terminal. So pay attention to wording and which apps are needed to complete the assignment. 

Now that I realized I needed the Terminal app, I had to be reminded on how to input wording and not use \$ and to copy and paste because if you type in an error can occur. Remember that \$ is input and the \> is the output. When copying and pasting don't include \$.

To copy and paste into a terminal you can use ctrl shift C or ctrl shift v or shift insert.

As your adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent just know that every time you input Agent pid changes numbers. Seems to be normal.

Now when you get to the passphrase, you can just press enter, there is no need to enter a passphrase. Chuck was like enter enter enter which is very helpful but you can if you'd like. For me the less I have to type the better. When someone is watching you like Andrew is me because I am learning, you make mistakes because your nervous.  So the less I have to enter the better. 

Adding a new SSH key to your account was a little tricky and Andrew was awesome to help out. 

Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard. 

Then copy and past the cat and your key will displayed. 

copy from where the code starts with ssh. 

Then you go into github and add your key to github by clicking
