## Github First Timmer

### Don't Be Scared!


I was nervous when I first started setting up my GitHub account, but it's actually quite straightforward. The key is to pay attention and follow the instructions carefully.


### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key


To start, you'll need to generate a new SSH key using this link: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent


Don't copy and paste into your web browser - instead, open the Terminal app (it looks like a black screen with a prompt) and follow the instructions.


#### Important Tip: When you're typing in the Terminal, remember that /$ is just the prompt, not part of the command. So don't include it when copying and pasting!


To copy and paste into the Terminal, use Ctrl + Shift + C (or Ctrl + Shift + V or Shift + Insert) to select the text, then right-click and choose "Copy" or press Ctrl + C. When you want to paste, use Ctrl + Shift + V (or Shift + Insert).


### Step 2: Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent


As you add your SSH key to the agent, don't worry if the "Agent PID" changes - it's normal!


When you get to the passphrase prompt, you can just press Enter. There's no need to enter a passphrase - unless you want to, of course! For me, the less I have to type, the better.


### Step 3: Add Your SSH Key to GitHub


To add your SSH key to GitHub, copy and paste the public key into your clipboard (using Ctrl + Shift + C or similar). Then, open GitHub and click on the "Add a new SSH key" button.


Copy the code starting from "ssh-rsa..." and paste it into the "Key" field in GitHub. That's it!


#### Remember, setting up your GitHub account is just like solving a puzzle - take your time, follow the instructions carefully, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
